# Stochastic Processes Project – CNC Signal Analysis

This project analyzes CNC machining sensor signals as realizations of
stochastic processes.

## Objectives
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Time series characterization
- Correlation analysis
- AR / MA / ARMA modeling

## Dataset
Bosch CNC Machining Dataset (UCI ML Repository)

## Structure
- notebooks/: exploratory analysis
- src/: reusable functions
- results/: figures and tables
